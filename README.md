# RsGenetic

RsGenetic is a simple framework for executing a genetic algorithm in Rust.  
This library is far from complete, but should be usable for some purposes.

I am personally too busy to update this library at a consistent pace at the moment, but feel free
to contribute. I will look at Pull Requests and Issues.
