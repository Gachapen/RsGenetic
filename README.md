# RsGenetic

RsGenetic is a simple framework for executing a genetic algorithm in Rust.  
This library is far from complete, but should be usable for some purposes.

I am personally too busy to update this library at a consistent pace at the moment, but feel free
to contribute. I will look at Pull Requests and Issues.

I suggest you take a look at the `doc` folder if you want to learn how to use the library.
Examples are included.

This library has only been tested with Rust stable 1.5.0.
